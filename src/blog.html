                <p class="text-left"> <br> Hello! <br> <br> Recently I've taken Girl Develop It's JS101: JavaScript for Beginners &amp; Intermediate JavaScript weekend courses, I found the intermediate class quite challenging however I was really excited to be introduced to
                    some of the more advanced concepts. I've also continued attending monthly Bucks County Women in Tech meet ups. I have completed Udacity's entire Computer Science course, where they taught using Python. I am finding Python concepts
                    to be easily transferable to Javascript. <br><br> This month I took on another contract job, where I wrote Burkholders Design Center's <a href="https://www.burkholderdesigncenter.com" target="_blank">web page</a>. I wrote it using
                    HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and Gulp. It was my first time using a build tool. I think my favorite part of Gulp was the live reload. <br><br> I've also started volunteering with InEducation as a Web Designer. I've been asked to come up with
                    ideas for elements/features, re-design, and code the "My Achievements" page. I'm working with their team, and I'm really excited to see the final result! </div>

                <p class="text-left"> <br> Hello, <br> <br> These past two months I have dedicated myself to Udacity's Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program. I have completed Intro to HTML and CSS, Responsive Web Design Fundamentals, Responsive Images, Linux Command Line
                    Basics, How to Use Git and GitHub, and I am currently learning Python in Udacity's Computer Science course. <br> <br> After this, I will continue with the rest of JavaScript Basics, Intro to jQuery, Object-Oriented JavaScript, HTML5
                    Canvas, Website Performance Optimization, Browser Rendering Optimization, Intro to AJAX, JavaScript Design Patterns, and JavaScript Testing with an estimated graduation date of August 2016. <br> <br> Outside of Udacity, I'm excited
                    for this weeks GDI course, Intro To Command Line + Vim, and this month's Bucks County Women in Tech meet up, Introduction to Python! </div>
